# Games With Friends

This SPA website was completed by a team of 4 students during their study with General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive course. Games With Friends was made to be a niche service for gamers where you can sign-up, add your friends, add games you own to your library and compare libraries with your friends, as well as create gaming events and connect with new people over our global chat. 

For security - all user passwords are encrypted before they get sent to the database and no PSQL inputs the user can make are able to alter the database maliciously.

I want to give a quick thanks to the instructors Zara, Alex and Kasun for helping us throughout the course.

## Planning

We started by creating the basic layout of how we wanted the website to look which let us get a feel of what we were about to create. We then brainstormed waht we would need to complete for the MVP and what ideas were extra features to save for if we had time. After this we all assigned ourselves to what we'd each be working on and started to code.

Along the way we would check in and talk about what we all acheived/completed and used the 'Projects' feature of GitHub to track and plan tasks.

P.s. Planning diagrams are in the 'planning' folder.
